GitHub README – Task Manager API
Overview

The Task Manager API is a backend system built to manage tasks in a clean, secure, and scalable way. It focuses on real-world backend architecture, including authentication, authorization, and relational data modeling.

This project was built to simulate how professional task-based systems (like Jira or Asana) are structured on the server side.

What This Project Does

Allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks

Groups tasks under projects for better organization

Protects all actions using authentication and permissions

Ensures data consistency using a relational database

Key Features

JWT Authentication – only logged-in users can access protected routes

Permission-Based Authorization – users can only perform allowed actions

Project-Based Task Organization – tasks belong to projects

Clean Modular Architecture – separated controllers, services, DTOs, and entities

Data Validation & Error Handling – prevents invalid or unsafe operations

Tech Stack

NestJS

TypeScript

MySQL

TypeORM

REST APIs

Architecture Overview

Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests

Services contain business logic

DTOs validate incoming data

Entities represent database tables

This structure mirrors production-ready backend systems.

What I Learned

How to structure backend applications cleanly

How authentication and authorization work together

How to model relational data safely

How to debug and solve backend issues using documentation and tooling

Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates strong backend fundamentals and the ability to design systems that are secure, maintainable, and scalable.
